# Simple Initiative Tracker

This branch has the goal of revamping the initial app. 

The goal of the revamp is to make the code more readable, and to add some features I wanted to add. 
First change was adding the choice of group or individual initiative. 
Another feature to be added is the ability to start the combat and have a combat mode. 
So it is more interactive than just being a glorified notepad.
