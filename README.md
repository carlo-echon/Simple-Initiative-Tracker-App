# Simple Initiative Tracker

A simple app made with Flutter for initiative tracking in tabletop role-playing games. It was made with Old-School Essentials (OSE) and D&D 5e in mind.

## Features to be implemented (Hopefully)

- Connection with D&D API using the 2024 ruleset to make use of the free monsters in the basic rules.
- Having the group initiative be more in line with the rules of OSEs initiative system.
